MyReads is a web app that allows you to view bookshelves containing books that you want to read, are currently reading, or have read. You can also search for new books and add them to your collection.


## Requirements
Node and NPM are required to use MyReads
They can be downloaded [here](https:/nodejs.org/en/download/)


## Installation

###### Clone this repository:
* $ git clone https://github.com/treyCooper/reactnd-project-myreads.git
* $ cd reactnd-project-myreads
* $ npm install

## Launch

###### Start the server:
* $ npm start

MyReads will then open at http://localhost:3000

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## create-react-app
